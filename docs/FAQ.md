> Q. Why CEFR ?

<details>

  <summary>Answer</summary>

The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) was developed to provide a standardized framework for assessing and describing language proficiency levels. It was created by the Council of Europe as a means to promote language learning and communication across Europe.

CEFR has become widely recognized and used internationally as a reference tool for language teaching, curriculum development, and assessment. It provides a common language and set of descriptors to describe language proficiency levels from A1 (beginner) to C2 (advanced), allowing individuals and institutions to compare and align their language skills and qualifications.

The framework is helpful for language learners, teachers, employers, and educational institutions as it enables better communication and understanding of language abilities. It also facilitates the recognition and transferability of language qualifications and enhances mobility in educational and professional contexts.
